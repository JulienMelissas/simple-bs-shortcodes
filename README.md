Simple Bootstrap Shortcodes
===========================

A WordPress plugin that adds some simple Bootstrap shortcodes to be available to you in the editor.

Use the shortcodes like this:
 - Wrap ALL shortcodes in the `[columns]` shortcode first:
 - Use any shortcode provided, which right now includes:
  - `[half]`
  - `[one-third]`
  - `[two-thirds]'
  
For example:
```
[columns]
[one-third]
Content for the one-third block goes here!
[/one-third]
[two-thirds]
Content for the two-thirds block goes here!
[/two-thirds]
[/columns]
```
  
Also, feel free to fork this and modify as much as you want.
